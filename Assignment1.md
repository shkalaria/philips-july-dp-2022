Typical product database consists of two types of product components â€” product categories and product items. A product category is generally contain product items and also other product categories as its subcategories. Example Product Categories:

<li> Computers
<li>Desktops
<li>Laptops
<li>Peripherals
<li>Printers
<li>Cables

The Computers product category contains both the Desktops and the Laptops product categories as its subcategories. The Desktop category can contain a product item such as Compaq Presario 5050. Product items are usually individual, in the sense that they do not contain any product component within. Design and implement an PricingCalculator to list the dollar value of a product component or Product Category.
